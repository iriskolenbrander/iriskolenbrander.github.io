## About Me
I am a passionate biomedical engineer interested in AI and medical image analysis technologies and evaluating their impact on patient care. Detail-oriented and curious, I approach challenges systematically and with enthusiasm. I enjoy working in environments where goals are clearly defined and aligned with a shared vision. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, playing field hockey, or traveling (whether for the food, landscape sceneries, or simply to unwind in the sun).
