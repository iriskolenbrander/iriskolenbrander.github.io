abstract: "Deep learning models have revolutionized image registration but their accuracy
  can degrade under unforeseen data variations (domain shifts). It is crucial to assess
  model robustness under such shifts, often accomplished using simulated domain shifts
  and expert annotations, e.g., landmarks. This work presents ProactiV-Reg, an annotation-free
  approach that utilizes a learnable image mapping: it iteratively adjusts a moving
  image to align with a fixed image under simulated domain shifts. The distances between
  the perturbed and the optimized images reveal model robustness. We evaluate ProactiV-Reg
  on three models, showcasing its ability to detect robustness differences, identify
  dominant perturbations, and provide insights into the model's input requirements."
